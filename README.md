PMSN-Matching
=============

This is the implementation of our Infocom 2012/JSAC 2013 paper: 'Privacy-Preserving Profile Matching for Proximity-based Social Networking'. If you are interested please refer to http://cnsg.asu.edu/files/rui-JSAC13-1.pdf

We impmeted and tested all the three levels of privacy and the max-distance matching on Andriod platform.

We used the Bluetooth in smartphone for communication and built the system on the Android SDK example com.example.android.BluetootchChat. Two Android devices are needed to test the system.
